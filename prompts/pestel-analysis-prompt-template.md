2. Use the template to guide the AI in analyzing each PESTEL factor, detailing its potential impact on the project or product.
3. Review the AI-generated analysis for accuracy and insights, then apply these findings to strategic planning and risk management.

## Instructions for AI-Assisted PESTEL Analysis:
1. **Preparation**: Collect all pertinent data about the project/product's external environment.
2. **Analysis Execution**: Instruct the AI to elaborate on each PESTEL factor using the data provided, identifying impacts on the project/product.
3. **Review and Interpretation**: Evaluate the AI's analysis for depth and accuracy. Use the insights to identify strategic opportunities and threats.
4. **Strategic Planning**: Incorporate the PESTEL analysis findings into strategic planning, adjusting to align with the identified external factors.
