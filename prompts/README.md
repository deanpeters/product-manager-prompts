# Strategic Product Management Frameworks

**AI-assisted tools for the strategic work of product management**

This collection helps you with both the strategic work (market positioning, customer discovery, competitive analysis) and the execution work (user stories, requirements, stakeholder communication). Each prompt creates a guided conversation with AI to help you think through problems systematically.

---

## How These Actually Work

These aren't fill-in-the-blank templates. They're structured conversations with AI that help you think through complex problems step by step.

**The approach:**
- AI asks you questions to understand your specific situation
- Context builds gradually instead of overwhelming you upfront
- Built-in quality control - AI knows when to ask for missing information
- Based on proven PM frameworks like Jobs-to-be-Done, Value Proposition Canvas, etc.

**The teaching layer:**
Every prompt has comment blocks that teach you how to work better with AI. When you view the raw code, you'll see:
```markdown
<!-- 
## Description: Why this framework matters for PMs
## Usage Note: What context you need before starting  
## Instructions: How AI should guide the conversation
-->
```
Read these comments first - they'll help you understand not just what to do, but why it works.

## Getting Started

### If you're new to AI-assisted PM work
1. **Start simple** - Try [positioning-statement.md](positioning-statement.md) or [jobs-to-be-done.md](jobs-to-be-done.md)
2. **Read the comments first** - They teach you how to think with AI strategically
3. **Answer questions thoroughly** - Better context leads to better insights
4. **Iterate** - Use AI's follow-up questions to go deeper

### If you're comfortable with AI
1. **Study the structure** - Notice how questions build strategic context
2. **Customize for your situation** - Adapt prompts for your industry and company
3. **Combine approaches** - Use multiple prompts for comprehensive analysis
4. **Create your own variations** - Build on these patterns for unique challenges

## Why This Approach Works

**Context before content** - AI understands your specific situation before generating generic advice

**Framework-guided thinking** - Uses proven PM methodologies like Jobs-to-be-Done, PESTEL, Value Prop Canvas

**Progressive discovery** - Builds complexity gradually instead of overwhelming you upfront

**Built-in quality control** - AI knows when to ask for missing information and how to validate assumptions

---

- **Industry-specific examples** - Add scenarios common in your domain
- **Organizational context** - Modify for your company's decision-making process
- **Stakeholder language** - Adapt terminology for your audience
- **Tool integration** - Reference your specific tools (Jira, Figma, etc.)

### Building Your Own Variations
1. **Keep the comment structure** - Maintain the teaching methodology
2. **Preserve the conversational flow** - One question at a time works best
3. **Add your domain expertise** - Include frameworks specific to your industry
4. **Test across platforms** - Make sure it works in ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini

## Getting Better Results

### Before You Start
- **Gather context** - Have relevant docs, data, or examples ready
- **Know your objective** - What decision are you trying to make?
- **Plan to iterate** - These are starting points, not final answers

### During Your Session
- **Take time with AI questions** - Don't rush through the conversation
- **Ask follow-ups** - "What else should I consider?"
- **Challenge assumptions** - "What are the risks with this approach?"
- **Explore alternatives** - "What other frameworks might apply?"

### After Your Session
- **Validate with real people** - AI provides analysis, humans make decisions
- **Document what you learned** - What worked? What would you change?
- **Share insights** - Help others learn from your experience
