## üß† Learning from Experimental Results

### **What We're Discovering**
Early experiments reveal:
- **AI excels at synthesis** across large amounts of information
- **Simulation quality depends** on input scenario richness
- **Human oversight remains critical** for strategic decision validation
- **Iterative refinement** dramatically improves output quality
- **Context preservation** enables more sophisticated reasoning chains

### **Emerging Best Practices**
- **Start with rich context** - Better inputs yield exponentially better outputs
- **Design for iteration** - Build refinement loops into experimental workflows
- **Log decision rationale** - Track why AI agents made specific choices
